# Flame

A simulated flame driven by CSS filters and CSS animations with a homemade vanilla JavaScript UI and custom swipe gestures. This project also explored CSS variables (e.g., `--flame-color`) and their usage within CSS's built-in `calc()` function, as well as JavaScript hooks into those variables via a custom `data-css-val` property on `range`-type input elements.
